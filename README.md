# ayto-matcher

Had some fun implementing a simple generator to create all possible combinations and to use insights from matching nights, no matches or perfect matches to reduce these possibilities down to valid matches.

After last matching night 8th (2023-10-12) the final pairs are clear.

```
Kim <-> Teezy
Steffi <-> Emanuell
Sabrina <-> Mike
Paulina <-> Peter / Max
Shakira <-> Marvin
Jennifer <-> Paco
Sandra <-> Steffen
Marie <-> Fabio
Alicia <-> Elia
```
